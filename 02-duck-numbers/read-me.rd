Description
Your next task is to determine whether a number is a Duck number. A Duck number is a positive number that contains zeroes. For example, 3210, 8050896, 70709 are Duck numbers.

In this stage, we need to simplify the way we display the information. We already have several properties that we need to show; we are going to add new features to our program in each stage. From now on, the card should follow this notation:

Properties of {number}
{property}: true/false
{property}: true/false
...
{property}: true/false

In this stage, the properties are even, odd, buzz and duck. For 14, the program output should look like this:

Properties of 14
        even: true
         odd: false
        buzz: true
        duck: false

The property order, indentation, and spaces are not checked by the tests. The tests are also case-insensitive.

Objectives
Your program should print the properties of a natural number. In this stage, your program should:

Ask a user to enter a natural number;
If the number is not natural, the program should print an error message;
If the number is natural, the program should indicate the properties of the number;
Finish the program after printing the message.
Examples
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

Example 1:

Enter a natural number:
> -7
This number is not natural!

Example 2:

Enter a natural number:
> 15
Properties of 15
        even: false
         odd: true
        buzz: false
        duck: false

Example 3:

Enter a natural number:
> 14
Properties of 14
        even: true
         odd: false
        buzz: true
        duck: false

Example 4:

Enter a natural number:
> 102
Properties of 102
        even: true
         odd: false
        buzz: false
        duck: true
